QUICK TEST SUMMARY
==================

Total Tests Run: 71
Passed: 68 (95.8%) 
Failed: 3 (4.2%) 

BREAKDOWN BY CATEGORY:
- Unit Tests (PII Detection): 21/23 passed (91.3%)
- Unit Tests (Redaction): 19/20 passed (95%)
- Integration Tests: 13/13 passed (100%) 
- Performance Tests: 15/15 passed (100%) 

FAILED TESTS (3 total):
1. test_pii_detection.py::TestPIIDetectionServiceBasic::test_detect_ssn
    Reason: SSN regex pattern not fully implemented
   
2. test_pii_detection.py::TestPIIDetectionServiceBasic::test_detect_phone_numbers
    Reason: Phone regex pattern not fully implemented
   
3. test_redaction_service.py::TestRedactionErrorHandling::test_unsupported_file_format
    Reason: Service logs error but doesn't raise exception (graceful handling)

HOW TO VIEW RESULTS
===================

Option 1 - Academic SRS Report (RECOMMENDED for documentation):
    Open: test_results_srs.txt

Option 3 - Detailed Execution Log:
    Open: test_results.log
    Contains: Raw pytest output with full test traces
    Use for: Debugging specific test failures

RUNNING TESTS AGAIN
===================

Run all tests:
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   python -m pytest tests/ -v

Run specific test file:
   python -m pytest tests/test_pii_detection.py -v
   python -m pytest tests/test_redaction_service.py -v
   python -m pytest tests/test_integration.py -v
   python -m pytest tests/test_performance.py -v

Run specific test class:
   python -m pytest tests/test_pii_detection.py::TestPIIDetectionServiceBasic -v

Run specific test:
   python -m pytest tests/test_pii_detection.py::TestPIIDetectionServiceBasic::test_service_initialization -v

Generate fresh HTML report:
   python -m pytest tests/ --html=test_report.html --self-contained-html

PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS
